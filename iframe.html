          <p align="left">Best time to visit the city is July and August, when it’s cool enough to not break a sweat and hot</br> enough to enjoy summer. The city which has quite a combination of both old and modern</br> textures is located by the river of Vistula.The historic Old Town, which was reconstructed after the World War II, with its late 18th</br> century characteristics, is a must-see. You can start your walk from the Nowy Świat Street</br> which will take you straight to the Old Town.Then you can go to the Powiśle area and take a walk on the newly renovated promenade on the</br> riverfront. There are also lots of cafes, bars and restaurants where you can shake off the</br>  exhaustion of the day. On Sundays, there are many parks where you can enjoy nature or listen to</br>  pianists from around the world playing Chopin.For museum lovers, you can add these to your list:
          <ul>
            <li>POLIN </li>
            <li>Warsaw Uprising Museum </li>
            <li>Fryderyk Chopin Museum</li>
          </ul>
